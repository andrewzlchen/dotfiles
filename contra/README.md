# How to flash Contra

You have two ways of flashing the Contra:

1. Go to [QMK Website](https://config.qmk.fm/#/contra/LAYOUT_ortho_4x12) or [kbfirware.com](kbfirmware.com)

The difference between the two is that QMK does not let you set the RGB but I think its more flexible. If I get another keyboard, then I could use QMK, but for now, just use kbfirmware since it lets you set the RGB lights.
